I am a full stack developer and recent graduate from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). I have both a BSc. and MSc. in computing and several years as a professional programmer writing trading systems. In addition, until recently, I ran my own design and build company [102 Interiors London](www.102interiors.co.uk).

I have chosen to return to the tech industry because I am find construction, both virtual and physical, immensly satisfying and want to be in an industry that continues to grow.

## Skills

## Excellent Communicator
As the site manager for the kitchen design business I ran teams of up to 20 contractors for any one job. It was vital that no man-days were lost due to poor communication, so I introduced management tools more usually seen in a corporate world. We all had a project planning app on our phones and we installed a, low tech, white board on site for clients and contractors to highlight issues and post reminders. Every Friday night I would email each client with a Friday-Night-Update. This FNU would detail what had been achieved during the week, any problems and the proposed solutions. It would also list what the work was for the coming week, anything I needed from the client and any inconvenience that they might expect.

## Analytical Thinker
All of my roles have had an analytical element. I thrive on mathematical challenges from developing the code to produce an informative and easy to read data analysis report to determining the most efficient flow of subterranean waste pipes in a kitchen development.


## Design & Detail Person
In code and kitchen design there can be a conflict between aesthetic and functionality. It is important that both are respected as both are achievable with some thought. An ugly but functioning environment is as unsatisfactory as a beautiful solution that only manages a subset of the requirements. While this is obvious with a kitchen it is also true in terms of data presentation, and of the read ability of the code.

## Thorough Implementer
All of the roles that I have held have required unit testing. Practical examples are easy to relate to, not testing the under-floor heating before laying the marble floor could be an expensive mistake, but at least you would know where the problem was. Knowing that each part of a development, code or otherwise, has been tested thoroughly makes me calm and confident.

## Enthusiast
From starting a new project to learning to water ski, I grab every challenge with both hands. I decided change careers and take a leap into wherever Makers Academy took me because I need to be stimulated and hate to be bored.

## Experience


## 102 Interiors London - Oct 2011 - 
I singlehandedly created a bespoke kitchen design and build company incorporating my experience in customer service as a graduate trainee for John Lewis, my attention to detail as a programmer and my extensive experience and contacts from property development. I designed and built the website and established a workable, repeatable model based on exclusivity, communication and my experience of being a working mother of 4. From the first kitchen in October 2011 we were fully booked for up to 24 months in advance. I encouraged a positive collaborative environment where project planning was key, and each trade was respected and given the time and materials to complete the task that they were given. Testing and checking and implementing ongoing maintenance solutions meant that each phase could be successfully signed off before the next phase started. We won customer service awards from Houzz, build quality awards from London Build Control and were featured in magazines such as Elle Decoration.
