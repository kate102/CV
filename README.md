* Recent graduate full stack developer at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/)
* BSc.in Maths & Computing and MSc. in Computing
* Several years as a professional programmer writing bond and equity trading systems
* Director and lead designer of design and build company [102 Interiors London](http://www.102interiors.co.uk/).

### Background

I reluctantly chose to leave the tech industry after the birth of my second child. So that I could balance the demands of a satisfying working career and a young family, I set up a kitchen design and build company that I ran from home. I am now at a point in my life when I can become a full time developer again. In order to learn the skills that are relevant to the industry as it is now, I attended a coding bootcamp. I find construction and innovation, both virtual and physical, immensely satisfying and look forward to working in an ever evolving environment again. 


### Skills

#### Technical Skills

* On the course I was involved in group projects to mimic Facebook in **Ruby** using the **Rails** Framework TDDing using **Rspec**, with the front end in **HTML** & **CSS** and the backend in **SQL**. We used **Travis** & **Heruko** for CI and **rubocop** as a linter.
* Another project was to mimic AirBnB in **JavaScript** using **JQuery** and **Node.js**. Testing was with **jasmine** and **cypress**, we used **ESLint** to clean the code and **Trello** to manage progress.
* To test my ability to pick up a new languages quickly, I wrote FizzBuzz in **Java** and **Python** and fully TDDed a Bowling Score Card kata in **Java**, recording my screen throughout. This recording the [Gutter Game](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5domwacxobr7k65/Gutter%20Game%20Java.mov?dl=0)and this recording covers [Rest of play to Spare Frame](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b2cow6t1kgw5wls/Frame_Basic_Spare_Games.mov?dl=0)
* My final project was a Machine Learning project. We reconfigured a Connect 4 game written in **python** to use **OpenAI gym** to generate training data. We then used **Keras** to build the model in **TensorFlow** to train the smart computer, Ulima, to win. We used **pytest** to TDD the code. This is a video of our [Final Project Presentation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x9ghds1lem5aiui/Final_Project.mov?dl=0).
All my code is here on [GitHub](https://github.com/kate102) or [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/kate102)

#### Soft Skills

##### Excellent Communicator
For 102 Interiors I managed teams of up to 20 contractors on any one site. Meetings are an anathema in the domestic construction industry so I had to find ways to ensure that the trades worked in harmony and that everyone knew what everyone else was doing and when. I introduced whiteboards, **Asana** project managment app and made lots of tea.

##### Analytical Thinker
All of my roles have had an analytical element. I thrive on mathematical challenges from developing clean code to produce an informative and easy to read data analysis report to determining the most efficient flow of subterranean waste pipes in a kitchen development.

##### Design & Detail Person
In code and kitchen design there can be a conflict between aesthetic and functionality. It is important that both are respected as both are achievable with some thought. An ugly but functioning environment is as unsatisfactory as a beautiful solution that only manages a subset of the requirements. 

##### Thorough Implementer
All of the roles that I have held have required thorough testing. Practical examples are easy to relate to, not testing the underfloor heating before laying the marble floor could be an expensive mistake. Knowing that each part of a development, code or otherwise, has been tested thoroughly makes me calm and confident.

##### Enthusiast
From starting a new project to learning to water ski, I grab every challenge with both hands.
