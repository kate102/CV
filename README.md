Kate Morris

I am a Makers Academy Boot Camp Alumni (not yet, clearly: to you Makers people reading this!). My journey to this position has been circumnavigated from a similar position, via a number of seemingly unrelated but, equally satisfying careers, hopefully back to the job I love the most. 

Following my M.Sc. in Formal Methods of Software Design [Safety Critical Systems] I was a successful programmer for many years. Due to my fear of boredom, a career break to start my family was also utilised build a substantial property portfolio. As my children gained independence, this skill set led to the creation of a successful and award-winning kitchen design company [Name of company or website?]. The smooth implementation package I had developed overtime for the kitchen design business meant that any demands were purely financial or political. I no longer felt challenged decided that now was the time to explore returning to programming.

The Makers Academy Boot Camp has brought me up to speed with how the industry operates now and I’m look for a role that utilizes the broad project skill I have built up, the technical skills that I have gained as well as the ones I have given a spring clean. It is important to me to work in an collaborative, diverse environment where there is mutual respect and vested interest in identifying and achieving the project goals


## Skills

# Excellent communicator
As the site manager for the kitchen design business I ran teams of up to 20 contractors for any one job. It was vital that no man-days were lost due to poor communication, so I introduced management tools more usually seen in a corporate world. We all had a project planning app on our phones and we installed a, low tech, white board on site for clients and contractors to highlight issues and post reminders. Every Friday night I would email each client with a Friday-Night-Update. This FNU would detail what had been achieved during the week, any problems and the proposed solutions. It would also list what the work was for the coming week, anything I needed from the client and any inconvenience that they might expect.
